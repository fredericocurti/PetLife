This is a fully working prototype of a web app made with Materialize CSS, HTML and JavaScript. It was made with the help of our Green Piece team for the Application Co-Design subject at Insper.

To properly view the HTML page, launch developer mode on Chrome and simulate the display of a Nexus 5 or phone with similar DPI.
